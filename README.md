First, install the necessary dependencies, using the following command:

npm install 
Then, in the command prompt run the following command to enter the MySQL shell:

mysql -u <name of the user> -p 
An example user can be root.If you have set a password for the user, you will be prompted for the password. Enter the password there, and login to the MySQL shell.

Then, in the MySQL shell run the following command to create the database. Script for the database resides in the db folder.

source db/schema.sql
After that, amend the variables in the .env file. Finally, when you have amended the .env file with proper variable, you can run the following command to seed data to the database. Seeding creates the tables and insert some rows in those tables.

node seeds
